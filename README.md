## Multidimensional-Kalman-Filter-with-Sensor-Fusion


### Task description
Take your smart phone and run for about 100 meters with a constant speed approximately. Your task is to estimate the trajectory where you ran with your phone. To estimate the trajectory, you are asked to incorporate sensor measurements that are available in your mobile phone (e.g., accelerometer, gyroscope, GPS sensor, etc). You need to implement Multidimensional Kalman filter with sensor fusion in order to solve this task. In the report clearly explain all the assumptions you made.
